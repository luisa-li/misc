2024 so far has been a huge travel year for me, and a big pastime for me when I'm on the move is reading. So I've made a map of all the books I've read thus far, and where I read them. This is sort of supporting work for an upcoming blog, where I do a quick (maybe not so quick if I have a lot to say) review of the books I've read, and the reading map that goes along with it.
