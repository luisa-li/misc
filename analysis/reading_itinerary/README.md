2024 so far has been a huge travel year for me, and a big pastime for me when I'm on the move is reading. So I've made a map of all the books I've read thus far, and where I read them. This is sort of supporting work for an upcoming blog, where I do a quick (maybe not so quick if I have a lot to say) review of the books I've read, and the reading map that goes along with it. 

Here is the book list, along with the locations: 
- Hunger Games Trilogy, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins - Flight from Lima to Boston
- Hunger Games Trilogy, Catching Fire by Suzanne Collinss - Flight from Boston to DC, at DC in between and IDKHOW concert, and flight from DC to Boston.
